To use it, you must distribute a native\n`<input>` yourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would\nnormally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value =\n'foo'`), no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s\n'`value` property; this property can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you\n_must_ set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be\nnotified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed\n`input`'s validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for\nstyling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate`\nattribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an\n[`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use\nthe `allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature is separate\nfrom validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is\nvalidated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <slot id=\"content\"></slot>\n`,\n\n  is: 'iron-input',\n  behaviors: [IronValidatableBehavior],\n\n  /**\n   * Fired whenever `validate()` is called.\n   *\n   * @event iron-input-validate\n   */\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * Use this property instead of `value` for two-way data binding, or to\n     * set a default value for the input. **Do not** use the distributed\n     * input's `value` property to set a default value.\n     */\n    bindValue: {type: String, value: ''},\n\n    /**\n     * Computed property that echoes `bindValue` (mostly used for Polymer 1.0\n     * backcompatibility, if you were one-way binding to the Polymer 1.0\n     * `input is=\"iron-input\"` value attribute).\n     */\n    value: {type: String, computed: '_computeValue(bindValue)'},\n\n    /**\n     * Regex-like list of characters allowed as input; all characters not in the\n     * list will be rejected.

If\nthe \"content\" element triggers an `iron-select` event, the `paper-menu-button`\nwill close automatically.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-menu-button>\n      <paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"\nslot=\"dropdown-trigger\"></paper-icon-button> <paper-listbox\nslot=\"dropdown-content\"> <paper-item>Share</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Settings</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Help</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-menu-button>\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-menu-button-dropdown-background` | Background color of the paper-menu-button dropdown | `--primary-background-color`\n`--paper-menu-button` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button | `{}`\n`--paper-menu-button-disabled` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-menu-button-dropdown` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button dropdown | `{}`\n`--paper-menu-button-content` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button content | `{}`\n\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nexport const PaperMenuButton = Polymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n        position: relative;\n        padding: 8px;\n        outline: none;\n\n        @apply --paper-menu-button;\n      }\n\n      :host([disabled]) {\n        cursor: auto;\n        color: var(--disabled-text-color);\n\n        @apply --paper-menu-button-disabled;\n      }\n\n      iron-dropdown {\n        @apply --paper-menu-button-dropdown;\n      }\n\n      .dropdown-content {\n        @apply --shadow-elevation-2dp;\n\n        position: relative;\n        border-radius: 2px;\n        background-color: var(--paper-menu-button-dropdown-background, var(--primary-background-color));\n\n        @apply --paper-menu-button-content;\n      }\n\n      :host([vertical-align=\"top\"]) .dropdown-content {\n        margin-bottom: 20px;\n        margin-top: -10px;\n        top: 10px;\n      }\n\n      :host([vertical-align=\"bottom\"]) .dropdown-content {\n        bottom: 10px;\n        margin-bottom: -10px;\n        margin-top: 20px;\n      }\n\n      #trigger {\n        cursor: pointer;\n      }\n    </style>\n\n    <div id=\"trigger\" on-tap=\"toggle\">\n      <slot name=\"dropdown-trigger\"></slot>\n    </div>\n\n    <iron-dropdown id=\"dropdown\" opened=\"{{opened}}\" horizontal-align=\"[[horizontalAlign]]\" vertical-align=\"[[verticalAlign]]\" dynamic-align=\"[[dynamicAlign]]\" horizontal-offset=\"[[horizontalOffset]]\" vertical-offset=\"[[verticalOffset]]\" no-overlap=\"[[noOverlap]]\" open-animation-config=\"[[openAnimationConfig]]\" close-animation-config=\"[[closeAnimationConfig]]\" no-animations=\"[[noAnimations]]\" focus-target=\"[[_dropdownContent]]\" allow-outside-scroll=\"[[allowOutsideScroll]]\" restore-focus-on-close=\"[[restoreFocusOnClose]]\" on-iron-overlay-canceled=\"__onIronOverlayCanceled\">\n      <div slot=\"dropdown-content\" class=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <slot id=\"content\" name=\"dropdown-content\"></slot>\n      </div>\n    </iron-dropdown>\n`,\n\n  is: 'paper-menu-button',\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the dropdown opens.\n   *\n   * @event paper-dropdown-open\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the dropdown closes.\n   *\n   * @event paper-dropdown-close\n   */\n\n  behaviors: [IronA11yKeysBehavior, IronControlState],\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * True if the content is currently displayed.\n     */\n    opened:\n        {type: Boolean, value: false, notify: true, observer: '_openedChanged'},\n\n    /**\n     * The orientation against which to align the menu dropdown\n     * horizontally relative to the dropdown trigger.\n     */\n    horizontalAlign: {type: String, value: 'left', reflectToAttribute: true},\n\n    /**\n     * The orientation against which to align the menu dropdown\n     * vertically relative to the dropdown trigger.\n     */\n    verticalAlign: {type: String, value: 'top', reflectToAttribute: true},\n\n    /**\n     * If true, the `horizontalAlign` and `verticalAlign` properties will\n     * be considered preferences instead of strict requirements when\n     * positioning the dropdown and may be changed if doing so reduces\n     * the area of the dropdown falling outside of `fitInto`.\n     */\n    dynamicAlign: {type: Boolean},\n\n    /**\n     * A pixel value that will be added to the position calculated for the\n     * given `horizontalAlign`.

The interactive nature of the slider makes it a\ngreat choice for settings that reflect intensity levels, such as volume,\nbrightness, or color saturation.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-slider></paper-slider>\n\nUse `min` and `max` to specify the slider range.  Default is 0 to 100.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-slider min=\"10\" max=\"200\" value=\"110\"></paper-slider>\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-slider-container-color` | The background color of the bar | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-bar-color` | The background color of the slider | `transparent`\n`--paper-slider-active-color` | The progress bar color | `--google-blue-700`\n`--paper-slider-secondary-color` | The secondary progress bar color | `--google-blue-300`\n`--paper-slider-knob-color` | The knob color | `--google-blue-700`\n`--paper-slider-disabled-knob-color` | The disabled knob color | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-pin-color` | The pin color | `--google-blue-700`\n`--paper-slider-font-color` | The pin's text color | `#fff`\n`--paper-slider-markers-color` | The snaps markers color | `#000`\n`--paper-slider-disabled-active-color` | The disabled progress bar color | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-disabled-secondary-color` | The disabled secondary progress bar color | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-knob-start-color` | The fill color of the knob at the far left | `transparent`\n`--paper-slider-knob-start-border-color` | The border color of the knob at the far left | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-pin-start-color` | The color of the pin at the far left | `--paper-grey-400`\n`--paper-slider-height` | Height of the progress bar | `2px`\n`--paper-slider-input` | Mixin applied to the input in editable mode | `{}`\n`--paper-slider-input-container-input` | Mixin applied to the paper-input-container-input in editable mode | `{}`\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-slider\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: template,\n\n  is: 'paper-slider',\n\n  behaviors: [\n    IronA11yKeysBehavior,\n    IronFormElementBehavior,\n    PaperInkyFocusBehavior,\n    IronRangeBehavior\n  ],\n\n  properties: {\n    value: {\n      type: Number,\n      value: 0,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * If true, the slider thumb snaps to tick marks evenly spaced based\n     * on the `step` property value.\n     */\n    snaps: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      value: false,\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * If true, a pin with numeric value label is shown when the slider thumb\n     * is pressed.

Use this element if you're concerned about\nthe performance of this element, i.e., if you plan on using many dropdowns on\nthe same page. Note that this element has a slightly different styling API\nthan `paper-dropdown-menu`.\n\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` is similar to a native browser select element.\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` works with selectable content. The currently\nselected item is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label`\nis displayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu-light label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu-light>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an\n[`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect) event when a child is\ndeselected. The selected or deselected item must be passed as the event's\n`detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled-opacity` | The opacity of the dropdown when disabled  | `0.33`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-color` | The color of the input/label/underline when the dropdown is unfocused | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-focus-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is focused  | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-error-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is invalid  | `--error-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | Mixin appled to the input | `{}`\n\nNote that in this element, the underline is just the bottom border of the\n\"input\".

It then parses\nthat state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`\nrelated to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that\ndid not match.\n\nHere is a basic example, when used with `app-location`:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{data}}\"\n        tail=\"{{tail}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, the `app-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the\n`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If\nthe `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `app-route` will set or update\nits `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters\nin `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'/about'`, the\nvalue of `data` would be `{\"page\": \"about\"}`.\n\nThe `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the\n`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.\n\nHere is another example, where `tail` is used:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{routeData}}\"\n        tail=\"{{subroute}}\">\n    </app-route>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{subroute}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:id\"\n        data=\"{{subrouteData}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, there are two `app-route` elements. The first\n`app-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first\n`app-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from\nits `tail`. The second `app-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it\nmatches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `data`.\n\nSo, when `route.path` is `'/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like\nthis: `{ page: 'about' }`\n\nAnd `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to\n`'/article/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:\n`{ page: 'article' }`\n\nAnd the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`\n\n`app-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects\nthey produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,\nthe `app-route` will update `route.path`. This in-turn will update the\n`app-location`, and cause the global location bar to change its value.\n\n@element app-route\n@demo demo/index.html\n@demo demo/data-loading-demo.html\n@demo demo/simple-demo.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  is: 'app-route',\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * The URL component managed by this element.\n     */\n    route: {\n      type: Object,\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The pattern of slash-separated segments to match `route.path` against.\n     *\n     * For example the pattern \"/foo\" will match \"/foo\" or \"/foo/bar\"\n     * but not \"/foobar\".\n     *\n     * Path segments like `/:named` are mapped to properties on the `data`\n     * object.\n     */\n    pattern: {\n      type: String,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The parameterized values that are extracted from the route as\n     * described by `pattern`.\n     */\n    data: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {};\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Auto activate route if path empty\n     */\n    autoActivate: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      value: false,\n    },\n\n    _queryParamsUpdating: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      value: false,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * @type {?Object}\n     */\n    queryParams: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {};\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The part of `route.path` NOT consumed by `pattern`.\n     */\n    tail: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {\n          path: null,\n          prefix: null,\n          __queryParams: null,\n        };\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Whether the current route is active.

Similarly, `blur()` will blur the element.\n\n### Styling\n\nSee `Polymer.PaperInputContainer` for a list of custom properties used to\nstyle this element.\n\nThe following custom properties and
