When the\nuser touches the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.\n\n`paper-icon-button` does not include a default icon set. To use icons from the\ndefault set, include `PolymerElements/iron-icons/iron-icons.html`, and use the\n`icon` attribute to specify which icon from the icon set to use.\n\n    <paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"></paper-icon-button>\n\nSee [`iron-iconset`](iron-iconset) for more information about\nhow to use a custom icon set.\n\nExample:\n\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      import '@polymer/iron-icons/iron-icons.js';\n    </script>\n\n    <paper-icon-button icon=\"favorite\"></paper-icon-button>\n    <paper-icon-button src=\"star.png\"></paper-icon-button>\n\nTo use `paper-icon-button` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag.

The\neffect can be visualized as a concentric circle with motion.\n\nExample:\n\n    <div style=\"position:relative\">\n      <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n    </div>\n\nNote, it's important that the parent container of the ripple be relative\nposition, otherwise the ripple will emanate outside of the desired container.\n\n`paper-ripple` listens to \"mousedown\" and \"mouseup\" events so it would display\nripple effect when touches on it.  You can also defeat the default behavior and\nmanually route the down and up actions to the ripple element.  Note that it is\nimportant if you call `downAction()` you will have to make sure to call\n`upAction()` so that `paper-ripple` would end the animation loop.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-ripple id=\"ripple\" style=\"pointer-events: none;\"></paper-ripple>\n    ...\n    downAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.downAction(e.detail);\n    },\n    upAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.upAction();\n    }\n\nStyling ripple effect:\n\n  Use CSS color property to style the ripple:\n\n    paper-ripple {\n      color: #4285f4;\n    }\n\n  Note that CSS color property is inherited so it is not required to set it on\n  the `paper-ripple` element directly.\n\nBy default, the ripple is centered on the point of contact.  Apply the\n`recenters` attribute to have the ripple grow toward the center of its\ncontainer.\n\n    <paper-ripple recenters></paper-ripple>\n\nYou can also  center the ripple inside its container from the start.\n\n    <paper-ripple center></paper-ripple>\n\nApply `circle` class to make the rippling effect within a circle.\n\n    <paper-ripple class=\"circle\"></paper-ripple>\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-ripple\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: block;\n        position: absolute;\n        border-radius: inherit;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        top: 0;\n        left: 0;\n        right: 0;\n        bottom: 0;\n\n        /* See PolymerElements/paper-behaviors/issues/34.

To use it, you must distribute a native\n`<input>` yourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would\nnormally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value =\n'foo'`), no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s\n'`value` property; this property can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you\n_must_ set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be\nnotified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed\n`input`'s validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for\nstyling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate`\nattribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an\n[`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use\nthe `allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature is separate\nfrom validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is\nvalidated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <slot id=\"content\"></slot>\n`,\n\n  is: 'iron-input',\n  behaviors: [IronValidatableBehavior],\n\n  /**\n   * Fired whenever `validate()` is called.\n   *\n   * @event iron-input-validate\n   */\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * Use this property instead of `value` for two-way data binding, or to\n     * set a default value for the input. **Do not** use the distributed\n     * input's `value` property to set a default value.\n     */\n    bindValue: {type: String, value: ''},\n\n    /**\n     * Computed property that echoes `bindValue` (mostly used for Polymer 1.0\n     * backcompatibility, if you were one-way binding to the Polymer 1.0\n     * `input is=\"iron-input\"` value attribute).\n     */\n    value: {type: String, computed: '_computeValue(bindValue)'},\n\n    /**\n     * Regex-like list of characters allowed as input; all characters not in the\n     * list will be rejected.

The currently selected\nitem is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is\ndisplayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an\n[`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect) event when a child is\ndeselected. The selected or deselected item must be passed as the event's\n`detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n\nYou can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`\nstyle mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button\nrespectively.\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-dropdown-menu\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style include=\"paper-dropdown-menu-shared-styles\"></style>\n\n    <!-- this div fulfills an a11y requirement for combobox, do not remove -->\n    <span role=\"button\"></span>\n    <paper-menu-button id=\"menuButton\" vertical-align=\"[[verticalAlign]]\" horizontal-align=\"[[horizontalAlign]]\" dynamic-align=\"[[dynamicAlign]]\" vertical-offset=\"[[_computeMenuVerticalOffset(noLabelFloat, verticalOffset)]]\" disabled=\"[[disabled]]\" no-animations=\"[[noAnimations]]\" on-iron-select=\"_onIronSelect\" on-iron-deselect=\"_onIronDeselect\" opened=\"{{opened}}\" close-on-activate allow-outside-scroll=\"[[allowOutsideScroll]]\" restore-focus-on-close=\"[[restoreFocusOnClose]]\">\n      <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-menu-button 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n      <div class=\"dropdown-trigger\" slot=\"dropdown-trigger\">\n        <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n        <!-- paper-input has type=\"text\" for a11y, do not remove -->\n        <paper-input type=\"text\" invalid=\"[[invalid]]\" readonly disabled=\"[[disabled]]\" value=\"[[value]]\" placeholder=\"[[placeholder]]\" error-message=\"[[errorMessage]]\" always-float-label=\"[[alwaysFloatLabel]]\" no-label-float=\"[[noLabelFloat]]\" label=\"[[label]]\">\n          <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-input 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n          <iron-icon icon=\"paper-dropdown-menu:arrow-drop-down\" suffix slot=\"suffix\"></iron-icon>\n        </paper-input>\n      </div>\n      <slot id=\"content\" name=\"dropdown-content\" slot=\"dropdown-content\"></slot>\n    </paper-menu-button>\n`,\n\n  is: 'paper-dropdown-menu',\n\n  behaviors: [\n    IronButtonState,\n    IronControlState,\n    IronFormElementBehavior,\n    IronValidatableBehavior\n  ],\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * The derived \"label\" of the currently selected item.

Use this element if you're concerned about\nthe performance of this element, i.e., if you plan on using many dropdowns on\nthe same page. Note that this element has a slightly different styling API\nthan `paper-dropdown-menu`.\n\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` is similar to a native browser select element.\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` works with selectable content. The currently\nselected item is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label`\nis displayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu-light label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu-light>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an\n[`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect) event when a child is\ndeselected. The selected or deselected item must be passed as the event's\n`detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled-opacity` | The opacity of the dropdown when disabled  | `0.33`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-color` | The color of the input/label/underline when the dropdown is unfocused | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-focus-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is focused  | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-error-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is invalid  | `--error-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | Mixin appled to the input | `{}`\n\nNote that in this element, the underline is just the bottom border of the\n\"input\".
