You can continue to use the native `input` as you would\nnormally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value =\n'foo'`), no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s\n'`value` property; this property can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you\n_must_ set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be\nnotified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed\n`input`'s validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for\nstyling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate`\nattribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an\n[`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use\nthe `allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature is separate\nfrom validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is\nvalidated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <slot id=\"content\"></slot>\n`,\n\n  is: 'iron-input',\n  behaviors: [IronValidatableBehavior],\n\n  /**\n   * Fired whenever `validate()` is called.\n   *\n   * @event iron-input-validate\n   */\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * Use this property instead of `value` for two-way data binding, or to\n     * set a default value for the input. **Do not** use the distributed\n     * input's `value` property to set a default value.\n     */\n    bindValue: {type: String, value: ''},\n\n    /**\n     * Computed property that echoes `bindValue` (mostly used for Polymer 1.0\n     * backcompatibility, if you were one-way binding to the Polymer 1.0\n     * `input is=\"iron-input\"` value attribute).\n     */\n    value: {type: String, computed: '_computeValue(bindValue)'},\n\n    /**\n     * Regex-like list of characters allowed as input; all characters not in the\n     * list will be rejected.

The currently selected\nitem is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is\ndisplayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an\n[`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect) event when a child is\ndeselected. The selected or deselected item must be passed as the event's\n`detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n\nYou can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`\nstyle mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button\nrespectively.\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-dropdown-menu\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style include=\"paper-dropdown-menu-shared-styles\"></style>\n\n    <!-- this div fulfills an a11y requirement for combobox, do not remove -->\n    <span role=\"button\"></span>\n    <paper-menu-button id=\"menuButton\" vertical-align=\"[[verticalAlign]]\" horizontal-align=\"[[horizontalAlign]]\" dynamic-align=\"[[dynamicAlign]]\" vertical-offset=\"[[_computeMenuVerticalOffset(noLabelFloat, verticalOffset)]]\" disabled=\"[[disabled]]\" no-animations=\"[[noAnimations]]\" on-iron-select=\"_onIronSelect\" on-iron-deselect=\"_onIronDeselect\" opened=\"{{opened}}\" close-on-activate allow-outside-scroll=\"[[allowOutsideScroll]]\" restore-focus-on-close=\"[[restoreFocusOnClose]]\">\n      <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-menu-button 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n      <div class=\"dropdown-trigger\" slot=\"dropdown-trigger\">\n        <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n        <!-- paper-input has type=\"text\" for a11y, do not remove -->\n        <paper-input type=\"text\" invalid=\"[[invalid]]\" readonly disabled=\"[[disabled]]\" value=\"[[value]]\" placeholder=\"[[placeholder]]\" error-message=\"[[errorMessage]]\" always-float-label=\"[[alwaysFloatLabel]]\" no-label-float=\"[[noLabelFloat]]\" label=\"[[label]]\">\n          <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-input 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n          <iron-icon icon=\"paper-dropdown-menu:arrow-drop-down\" suffix slot=\"suffix\"></iron-icon>\n        </paper-input>\n      </div>\n      <slot id=\"content\" name=\"dropdown-content\" slot=\"dropdown-content\"></slot>\n    </paper-menu-button>\n`,\n\n  is: 'paper-dropdown-menu',\n\n  behaviors: [\n    IronButtonState,\n    IronControlState,\n    IronFormElementBehavior,\n    IronValidatableBehavior\n  ],\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * The derived \"label\" of the currently selected item.

By default, an app-header moves away from the viewport\nwhen scrolling down and if using `reveals`, the header slides back when\nscrolling back up. For example:\n\n```html\n<app-header reveals>\n  <app-toolbar>\n    <div main-title>App name</div>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\napp-header can also condense when scrolling down. To achieve this behavior, the\nheader must have a larger height than the `sticky` element in the light DOM. For\nexample:\n\n```html\n<app-header style=\"height: 96px;\" condenses fixed>\n  <app-toolbar style=\"height: 64px;\">\n    <div main-title>App name</div>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\nIn this case the header is initially `96px` tall, and it shrinks to `64px` when\nscrolling down. That is what is meant by \"condensing\".\n\n### Sticky element\n\nThe element that is positioned fixed to top of the header's `scrollTarget` when\na threshold is reached, similar to `position: sticky` in CSS. This element\n**must** be an immediate child of app-header. By default, the `sticky` element\nis the first `app-toolbar that is an immediate child of app-header.\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses>\n  <app-toolbar> Sticky element </app-toolbar>\n  <app-toolbar></app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n#### Customizing the sticky element\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses>\n  <app-toolbar></app-toolbar>\n  <app-toolbar sticky> Sticky element </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n### Scroll target\n\nThe app-header's `scrollTarget` property allows to customize the scrollable\nelement to which the header responds when the user scrolls. By default,\napp-header uses the document as the scroll target, but you can customize this\nproperty by setting the id of the element, e.g.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"scrollingRegion\" style=\"overflow-y: auto;\">\n  <app-header scroll-target=\"scrollingRegion\">\n  </app-header>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this case, the `scrollTarget` property points to the outer div element.\nAlternatively, you can set this property programmatically:\n\n```js\nappHeader.scrollTarget = document.querySelector(\"#scrollingRegion\");\n```\n\n## Backgrounds\napp-header has two background layers that can be used for styling when the\nheader is condensed or when the scrollable element is scrolled to the top.\n\n## Scroll effects\n\nScroll effects are _optional_ visual effects applied in app-header based on\nscroll position. For example, The [Material Design scrolling\ntechniques](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html)\nrecommends effects that can be installed via the `effects` property. e.g.\n\n```html\n<app-header effects=\"waterfall\">\n  <app-toolbar>App name</app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n#### Importing the effects\n\nTo use the scroll effects, you must explicitly import them in addition to\n`app-header`:\n\n```js\nimport '@polymer/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/app-scroll-effects.js';\n```\n\n#### List of effects\n\n* **blend-background**\nFades in/out two background elements by applying CSS opacity based on scroll\nposition. You can use this effect to smoothly change the background color or\nimage of the header. For example, using the mixin\n`--app-header-background-rear-layer` lets you assign a different background when\nthe header is condensed:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  background-color: red;\n  --app-header-background-rear-layer: {\n    /* The header is blue when condensed *\\/\n    background-color: blue;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n* **fade-background**\nUpon scrolling past a threshold, this effect will trigger an opacity transition\nto fade in/out the backgrounds. Compared to the `blend-background` effect, this\neffect doesn't interpolate the opacity based on scroll position.\n\n\n* **parallax-background**\nA simple parallax effect that vertically translates the backgrounds based on a\nfraction of the scroll position. For example:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  --app-header-background-front-layer: {\n    background-image: url(...);\n  };\n}\n```\n```html\n<app-header style=\"height: 300px;\" effects=\"parallax-background\">\n  <app-toolbar>App name</app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\nThe fraction determines how far the background moves relative to the scroll\nposition. This value can be assigned via the `scalar` config value and it is\ntypically a value between 0 and 1 inclusive. If `scalar=0`, the background\ndoesn't move away from the header.\n\n* **resize-title**\nProgressively interpolates the size of the title from the element with the\n`main-title` attribute to the element with the `condensed-title` attribute as\nthe header condenses. For example:\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses reveals effects=\"resize-title\">\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h4 condensed-title>App name</h4>\n  </app-toolbar>\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h1 main-title>App name</h1>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n* **resize-snapped-title**\nUpon scrolling past a threshold, this effect fades in/out the titles using\nopacity transitions. Similarly to `resize-title`, the `main-title` and\n`condensed-title` elements must be placed in the light DOM.\n\n* **waterfall**\nToggles the shadow property in app-header to create a sense of depth (as\nrecommended in the MD spec) between the header and the underneath content. You\ncan change the shadow by customizing the `--app-header-shadow` mixin. For\nexample:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  --app-header-shadow: {\n    box-shadow: inset 0px 5px 2px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses reveals effects=\"waterfall\">\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h1 main-title>App name</h1>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n* **material**\nInstalls the waterfall, resize-title, blend-background and parallax-background\neffects.\n\n### Content attributes\n\nAttribute | Description         | Default\n----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------\n`sticky` | Element that remains at the top when the header condenses. | The first app-toolbar in the light DOM.\n\n\n## Styling\n\nMixin | Description | Default\n------|-------------|----------\n`--app-header-background-front-layer` | Applies to the front layer of the background. | {}\n`--app-header-background-rear-layer` | Applies to the rear layer of the background. | {}\n`--app-header-shadow` | Applies to the shadow. | {}\n\n@element app-header\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-1.html Blend Background Image\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-2.html Blend 2 Background Images\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-3.html Blend Background Colors\n@demo app-header/demo/contacts.html Contacts Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/give.html Resize Snapped Title Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/music.html Reveals Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/no-effects.html Condenses and Reveals Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/notes.html Fixed with Dynamic Shadow Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/custom-sticky-element-1.html Custom Sticky Element Demo 1\n@demo app-header/demo/custom-sticky-element-2.html Custom Sticky Element Demo 2\n\n*/\nPolymer({\n  /** @override */\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        position: relative;\n        display: block;\n        transition-timing-function: linear;\n        transition-property: -webkit-transform;\n        transition-property: transform;\n      }\n\n      :host::before {\n        position: absolute;\n        right: 0px;\n        bottom: -5px;\n        left: 0px;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 5px;\n        content: \"\";\n        transition: opacity 0.4s;\n        pointer-events: none;\n        opacity: 0;\n        box-shadow: inset 0px 5px 6px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n        will-change: opacity;\n        @apply --app-header-shadow;\n      }\n\n      :host([shadow])::before {\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n\n      #background {\n        @apply --layout-fit;\n        overflow: hidden;\n      }\n\n      #backgroundFrontLayer,\n      #backgroundRearLayer {\n        @apply --layout-fit;\n        height: 100%;\n        pointer-events: none;\n        background-size: cover;\n      }\n\n      #backgroundFrontLayer {\n        @apply --app-header-background-front-layer;\n      }\n\n      #backgroundRearLayer {\n        opacity: 0;\n        @apply --app-header-background-rear-layer;\n      }\n\n      #contentContainer {\n        position: relative;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n      }\n\n      :host([disabled]),\n      :host([disabled])::after,\n      :host([disabled]) #backgroundFrontLayer,\n      :host([disabled]) #backgroundRearLayer,\n      /* Silent scrolling should not run CSS transitions */\n      :host([silent-scroll]),\n      :host([silent-scroll])::after,\n      :host([silent-scroll]) #backgroundFrontLayer,\n      :host([silent-scroll]) #backgroundRearLayer {\n        transition: none !important;\n      }\n\n      :host([disabled]) ::slotted(app-toolbar:first-of-type),\n      :host([disabled]) ::slotted([sticky]),\n      /* Silent scrolling should not run CSS transitions */\n      :host([silent-scroll]) ::slotted(app-toolbar:first-of-type),\n      :host([silent-scroll]) ::slotted([sticky]) {\n        transition: none !important;\n      }\n\n    </style>\n    <div id=\"contentContainer\">\n      <slot id=\"slot\"></slot>\n    </div>\n`,\n\n  is: 'app-header',\n  behaviors: [AppScrollEffectsBehavior, AppLayoutBehavior],\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * If true, the header will automatically collapse when scrolling down.\n     * That is, the `sticky` element remains visible when the header is fully\n     *condensed whereas the rest of the elements will collapse below `sticky`\n     *element.\n     *\n     * By default, the `sticky` element is the first toolbar in the light DOM:\n     *\n     *```html\n     * <app-header condenses>\n     *   <app-toolbar>This toolbar remains on top</app-toolbar>\n     *   <app-toolbar></app-toolbar>\n     *   <app-toolbar></app-toolbar>\n     * </app-header>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Additionally, you can specify which toolbar or element remains visible in\n     *condensed mode by adding the `sticky` attribute to that element.

It then parses\nthat state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`\nrelated to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that\ndid not match.\n\nHere is a basic example, when used with `app-location`:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{data}}\"\n        tail=\"{{tail}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, the `app-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the\n`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If\nthe `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `app-route` will set or update\nits `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters\nin `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'/about'`, the\nvalue of `data` would be `{\"page\": \"about\"}`.\n\nThe `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the\n`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.\n\nHere is another example, where `tail` is used:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{routeData}}\"\n        tail=\"{{subroute}}\">\n    </app-route>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{subroute}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:id\"\n        data=\"{{subrouteData}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, there are two `app-route` elements. The first\n`app-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first\n`app-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from\nits `tail`. The second `app-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it\nmatches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `data`.\n\nSo, when `route.path` is `'/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like\nthis: `{ page: 'about' }`\n\nAnd `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to\n`'/article/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:\n`{ page: 'article' }`\n\nAnd the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`\n\n`app-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects\nthey produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,\nthe `app-route` will update `route.path`. This in-turn will update the\n`app-location`, and cause the global location bar to change its value.\n\n@element app-route\n@demo demo/index.html\n@demo demo/data-loading-demo.html\n@demo demo/simple-demo.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  is: 'app-route',\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * The URL component managed by this element.\n     */\n    route: {\n      type: Object,\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The pattern of slash-separated segments to match `route.path` against.\n     *\n     * For example the pattern \"/foo\" will match \"/foo\" or \"/foo/bar\"\n     * but not \"/foobar\".\n     *\n     * Path segments like `/:named` are mapped to properties on the `data`\n     * object.\n     */\n    pattern: {\n      type: String,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The parameterized values that are extracted from the route as\n     * described by `pattern`.\n     */\n    data: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {};\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Auto activate route if path empty\n     */\n    autoActivate: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      value: false,\n    },\n\n    _queryParamsUpdating: {\n      type: Boolean,\n      value: false,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * @type {?Object}\n     */\n    queryParams: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {};\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * The part of `route.path` NOT consumed by `pattern`.\n     */\n    tail: {\n      type: Object,\n      value: function() {\n        return {\n          path: null,\n          prefix: null,\n          __queryParams: null,\n        };\n      },\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Whether the current route is active.

Use this element if you're concerned about\nthe performance of this element, i.e., if you plan on using many dropdowns on\nthe same page. Note that this element has a slightly different styling API\nthan `paper-dropdown-menu`.\n\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` is similar to a native browser select element.\n`paper-dropdown-menu-light` works with selectable content. The currently\nselected item is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label`\nis displayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu-light label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu-light>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an\n[`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect) event when a child is\ndeselected. The selected or deselected item must be passed as the event's\n`detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled-opacity` | The opacity of the dropdown when disabled  | `0.33`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-color` | The color of the input/label/underline when the dropdown is unfocused | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-focus-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is focused  | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-error-color` | The color of the label/underline when the dropdown is invalid  | `--error-color`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | Mixin appled to the input | `{}`\n\nNote that in this element, the underline is just the bottom border of the\n\"input\".

It will be centered\nto an anchor element specified in the `for` attribute, or, if that doesn't\nexist, centered to the parent node containing it.\nExample:\n    <div style=\"display:inline-block\">\n      <button>Click me!</button>\n      <paper-tooltip>Tooltip text</paper-tooltip>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</button>\n      <paper-tooltip for=\"btn\">Tooltip text</paper-tooltip>\n    </div>\nThe tooltip can be positioned on the top|bottom|left|right of the anchor using\nthe `position` attribute. The default position is bottom.\n    <paper-tooltip for=\"btn\" position=\"left\">Tooltip text</paper-tooltip>\n    <paper-tooltip for=\"btn\" position=\"top\">Tooltip text</paper-tooltip>\n\n###

For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"></app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Creating scroll effects\n *\n * You may want to create a custom scroll effect if you need to modify the CSS\n * of an element based on the scroll position.\n *\n * A scroll effect definition is an object with `setUp()`, `tearDown()` and\n * `run()` functions.\n *\n * To register the effect, you can use\n * `Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect(effectName, effectDef)` For example, let's\n * define an effect that resizes the header's logo:\n *\n * ```js\n * Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect('resizable-logo', {\n *   setUp: function(config) {\n *     // the effect's config is passed to the setUp.\n *     this._fxResizeLogo = { logo: Polymer.dom(this).querySelector('[logo]') };\n *   },\n *\n *   run: function(progress) {\n *      // the progress of the effect\n *      this.transform('scale3d(' + progress + ', '+ progress +', 1)',\n * this._fxResizeLogo.logo);\n *   },\n *\n *   tearDown: function() {\n *      // clean up and reset of states\n *      delete this._fxResizeLogo;\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n * Now, you can consume the effect:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header id=\"appHeader\" effects=\"resizable-logo\">\n *   <img logo src=\"logo.svg\">\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * ```js\n * var logoEffect = appHeader.createEffect('resizable-logo', effectConfig);\n * // run the effect: logoEffect.run(progress);\n * // tear down the effect: logoEffect.tearDown();\n * ```\n *\n * ### Configuring effects\n *\n * For effects installed via the `effects` property, their configuration can be\n * set via the `effectsConfig` property. For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"\n *   effects-config='{\"waterfall\": {\"startsAt\": 0, \"endsAt\": 0.5}}'>\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * All effects have a `startsAt` and `endsAt` config property. They specify at\n * what point the effect should start and end. This value goes from 0 to 1\n * inclusive.\n *\n * @polymerBehavior\n */\nexport const AppScrollEffectsBehavior = [\n  IronScrollTargetBehavior,\n  {\n\n    properties: {\n\n      /**\n       * A space-separated list of the effects names that will be triggered when\n       * the user scrolls. e.g. `waterfall parallax-background` installs the\n       * `waterfall` and `parallax-background`.\n       */\n      effects: {type: String},\n\n      /**\n       * An object that configurates the effects installed via the `effects`\n       * property. e.g.\n       * ```js\n       *  element.effectsConfig = {\n       *   \"blend-background\": {\n       *     \"startsAt\": 0.5\n       *   }\n       * };\n       * ```\n       * Every effect has at least two config properties: `startsAt` and\n       * `endsAt`.

In order for an element to be\nconsidered as a prefix, it must have the `prefix` attribute (and similarly\nfor `suffix`).\n\n    <paper-input label=\"total\">\n      <div prefix>$</div>\n      <paper-icon-button slot=\"suffix\" icon=\"clear\"></paper-icon-button>\n    </paper-input>\n\nA `paper-input` can use the native `type=search` or `type=file` features.\nHowever, since we can't control the native styling of the input (search icon,\nfile button, date placeholder, etc.), in these cases the label will be\nautomatically floated. The `placeholder` attribute can still be used for\nadditional informational text.\n\n    <paper-input label=\"search!\" type=\"search\"\n        placeholder=\"search for cats\" autosave=\"test\" results=\"5\">\n    </paper-input>\n\nSee `Polymer.PaperInputBehavior` for more API docs.\n\n### Focus\n\nTo focus a paper-input, you can call the native `focus()` method as long as the\npaper input has a tab index. Similarly, `blur()` will blur the element.\n\n### Styling\n\nSee `Polymer.PaperInputContainer` for a list of custom properties used to\nstyle this element.\n\nThe following custom properties and
