Execution in further ticks will be scheduled accordingly.\n *\n * If further execution requests have already been scheduled on the next tick, it can be checked with `hasNextTick`,\n * and cancelled with `clearNextTick`.\n *\n * The task can be scheduled as an interval repeatedly with a period as parameter (see `setInterval`, `clearInterval`).\n *\n * Sub-classes need to implement the `doTick` method which will effectively have the task execution routine.\n *\n * Further explanations:\n *\n * The baseclass has a `tick` method that will schedule the doTick call. It may be called synchroneously\n * only for a stack-depth of one. On re-entrant calls, sub-sequent calls are scheduled for next main loop ticks.\n *\n * When the task execution (`tick` method) is called in re-entrant way this is detected and\n * we are limiting the task execution per call stack to exactly one, but scheduling/post-poning further\n * task processing on the next main loop iteration (also known as \"next tick\" in the Node/JS runtime lingo).\n */\n\nexport default class TaskLoop extends EventHandler {\n  constructor (hls, ...events) {\n    super(hls, ...events);\n\n    this._tickInterval = null;\n    this._tickTimer = null;\n    this._tickCallCount = 0;\n    this._boundTick = this.tick.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @override\n   */\n  onHandlerDestroying () {\n    // clear all timers before unregistering from event bus\n    this.clearNextTick();\n    this.clearInterval();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean}\n   */\n  hasInterval () {\n    return !!this._tickInterval;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean}\n   */\n  hasNextTick () {\n    return !!this._tickTimer;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @param {number} millis Interval time (ms)\n   * @returns {boolean} True when interval has been scheduled, false when already scheduled (no effect)\n   */\n  setInterval (millis) {\n    if (!this._tickInterval) {\n      this._tickInterval = setInterval(this._boundTick, millis);\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean} True when interval was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n   */\n  clearInterval () {\n    if (this._tickInterval) {\n      clearInterval(this._tickInterval);\n      this._tickInterval = null;\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean} True when timeout was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n   */\n  clearNextTick () {\n    if (this._tickTimer) {\n      clearTimeout(this._tickTimer);\n      this._tickTimer = null;\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Will call the subclass doTick implementation in this main loop tick\n   * or in the next one (via setTimeout(,0)) in case it has already been called\n   * in this tick (in case this is a re-entrant call).\n   */\n  tick () {\n    this._tickCallCount++;\n    if (this._tickCallCount === 1) {\n      this.doTick();\n      // re-entrant call to tick from previous doTick call stack\n      // -> schedule a call on the next main loop iteration to process this task processing request\n      if (this._tickCallCount > 1) {\n        // make sure only one timer exists at any time at max\n        this.clearNextTick();\n        this._tickTimer = setTimeout(this._boundTick, 0);\n      }\n      this._tickCallCount = 0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * For subclass to implement task logic\n   * @abstract\n   */\n  doTick () {}\n}\n","const DECIMAL_RESOLUTION_REGEX = /^(\\d+)x(\\d+)$/; // eslint-disable-line no-useless-escape\nconst ATTR_LIST_REGEX = /\\s*(.+?)\\s*=((?:\\\".*?\\\")|.*?)(?:,|$)/g; // eslint-disable-line no-useless-escape\n\n// adapted from https://github.com/kanongil/node-m3u8parse/blob/master/attrlist.js\nclass AttrList {\n  constructor (attrs) {\n    if (typeof attrs === 'string') {\n      attrs = AttrList.parseAttrList(attrs);\n    }\n\n    for (let attr in attrs) {\n      if (attrs.hasOwnProperty(attr)) {\n        this[attr] = attrs[attr];\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  decimalInteger (attrName) {\n    const intValue = parseInt(this[attrName], 10);\n    if (intValue > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {\n      return Infinity;\n    }\n\n    return intValue;\n  }\n\n  hexadecimalInteger (attrName) {\n    if (this[attrName]) {\n      let stringValue = (this[attrName] || '0x').slice(2);\n      stringValue = ((stringValue.length & 1) ?
