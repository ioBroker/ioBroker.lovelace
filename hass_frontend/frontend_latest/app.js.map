When the viewport width is smaller than `responsiveWidth`, this element\nchanges to narrow layout. In narrow layout, the drawer will be stacked on top of\nthe main content. The drawer will slide in/out to hide/reveal the main content.\n\nBy default the drawer is aligned to the start, which is left in LTR layouts:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nAlign the drawer at the end:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\" align=\"end\">\n     drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nWith an app-header-layout:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer-content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <app-header-layout>\n    <app-header slot=\"header\">\n      <app-toolbar>\n        <div main-title>App name</div>\n      </app-toolbar>\n    </app-header>\n\n    main content\n\n  </app-header-layout>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nAdd the `drawer-toggle` attribute to elements inside `app-drawer-layout` that\ntoggle the drawer on click events:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer-content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <app-header-layout>\n    <app-header slot=\"header\">\n      <app-toolbar>\n        <paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\" drawer-toggle></paper-icon-button>\n        <div main-title>App name</div>\n      </app-toolbar>\n    </app-header>\n\n    main content\n\n  </app-header-layout>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\n**NOTE:** With app-layout 2.0, the `drawer-toggle` element needs to be manually\nhidden when app-drawer-layout is not in narrow layout. To add this, add the\nfollowing CSS rule where app-drawer-layout is used:\n\n```css\napp-drawer-layout:not([narrow]) [drawer-toggle] {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\nAdd the `fullbleed` attribute to app-drawer-layout to make it fit the size of\nits container:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout fullbleed>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n     drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\n### Styling\n\nCustom property                          | Description                          | Default\n-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------\n`--app-drawer-width`                     | Width of the drawer                  | 256px\n`--app-drawer-layout-content-transition` | Transition for the content container | none\n\n**NOTE:** If you use <app-drawer> with <app-drawer-layout> and specify a value\nfor\n`--app-drawer-width`, that value must be accessible by both elements. This can\nbe done by defining the value on the `:host` that contains <app-drawer-layout>\n(or `html` if outside a shadow root):\n\n```css\n:host {\n  --app-drawer-width: 300px;\n}\n```\n\n@group App Elements\n@element app-drawer-layout\n@demo app-drawer-layout/demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: block;\n        /**\n         * Force app-drawer-layout to have its own stacking context so that its parent can\n         * control the stacking of it relative to other elements.\n         */\n        position: relative;\n        z-index: 0;\n      }\n\n      :host ::slotted([slot=drawer]) {\n        z-index: 1;\n      }\n\n      :host([fullbleed]) {\n        @apply --layout-fit;\n      }\n\n      #contentContainer {\n        /* Create a stacking context here so that all children appear below the header. */\n        position: relative;\n        z-index: 0;\n        height: 100%;\n        transition: var(--app-drawer-layout-content-transition, none);\n      }\n\n      #contentContainer[drawer-position=left] {\n        margin-left: var(--app-drawer-width, 256px);\n      }\n\n      #contentContainer[drawer-position=right] {\n        margin-right: var(--app-drawer-width, 256px);\n      }\n    </style>\n\n    <slot id=\"drawerSlot\" name=\"drawer\"></slot>\n\n    <div id=\"contentContainer\" drawer-position\\$=\"[[_drawerPosition]]\">\n      <slot></slot>\n    </div>\n\n    <iron-media-query query=\"[[_computeMediaQuery(forceNarrow, responsiveWidth)]]\" on-query-matches-changed=\"_onQueryMatchesChanged\"></iron-media-query>\n`,\n\n  is: 'app-drawer-layout',\n  behaviors: [AppLayoutBehavior],\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * If true, ignore `responsiveWidth` setting and force the narrow layout.\n     */\n    forceNarrow: {type: Boolean, value: false},\n\n    /**\n     * If the viewport's width is smaller than this value, the panel will change\n     * to narrow layout.

As changes\noccur, `app-location` produces and updates an object called `route`. This\n`route` object is suitable for passing into a `app-route`, and other similar\nelements.\n\nAn example of the public API of a route object that describes the URL\n`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-location`:\n\n    {\n      prefix: '',\n      path: '/elements/app-location'\n    }\n\nExample Usage:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route route=\"{{route}}\" pattern=\"/:page\" data=\"{{data}}\"></app-route>\n\nAs you can see above, the `app-location` element produces a `route` and that\nproperty is then bound into the `app-route` element. The bindings are two-\ndirectional, so when changes to the `route` object occur within `app-route`,\nthey automatically reflect back to the global location.\n\n### Hashes vs Paths\n\nBy default `app-location` routes using the pathname portion of the URL. This has\nbroad browser support but it does require cooperation of the backend server. An\n`app-location` can be configured to use the hash part of a URL instead using\nthe `use-hash-as-path` attribute, like so:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\" use-hash-as-path></app-location>\n\n### Integrating with other routing code\n\nThere is no standard event that is fired when window.location is modified.\n`app-location` fires a `location-changed` event on `window` when it updates the\nlocation. It also listens for that same event, and re-reads the URL when it's\nfired. This makes it very easy to interop with other routing code.\n\nSo for example if you want to navigate to `/new_path` imperatively you could\ncall `window.location.pushState` or `window.location.replaceState` followed by\nfiring a `location-changed` event on `window`. i.e.\n\n    window.history.pushState({}, null, '/new_path');\n    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('location-changed'));\n\n@element app-location\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <iron-query-params params-string=\"{{__query}}\" params-object=\"{{queryParams}}\">\n    </iron-query-params>\n    <iron-location path=\"{{__path}}\" query=\"{{__query}}\" hash=\"{{__hash}}\" url-space-regex=\"[[urlSpaceRegex]]\" dwell-time=\"[[dwellTime]]\">\n    </iron-location>\n  `,\n\n  is: 'app-location',\n\n  properties: {\n    /**\n     * A model representing the deserialized path through the route tree, as\n     * well as the current queryParams.\n     */\n    route: {\n      type: Object,\n      notify: true,\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * In many scenarios, it is convenient to treat the `hash` as a stand-in\n     * alternative to the `path`.

Note that this is an old element, that was written\nbefore all modern browsers had non-prefixed flex styles. As such, nowadays you\ndon't really need to use this element anymore, and can use CSS flex styles\ndirectly in your code.\n\nThis component provides two different ways to use flexbox:\n\n1. [Layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nThe layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules,\nthat let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this\nfile in every element that needs to use them.\n\n    Sample use:\n\n    ```\n    <custom-element-demo>\n      <template>\n        <script src=\"../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js\"></script>\n        <next-code-block></next-code-block>\n      </template>\n    </custom-element-demo>\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    import {html} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/utils/html-tag.js';\n    import '@polymer/iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.js';\n\n    const template = html`\n      <style is=\"custom-style\" include=\"iron-flex iron-flex-alignment\"></style>\n      <style>\n        .test { width: 100px; }\n      </style>\n      <div class=\"layout horizontal center-center\">\n        <div class=\"test\">horizontal layout center alignment</div>\n      </div>\n    `;\n    document.body.appendChild(template.content);\n    ```\n\n2. [Custom CSS\nmixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).\nThe mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS\nrule using the `@apply` function.\n\nPlease note that the old [/deep/ layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)\nare deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties\ndirectly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based\n[layout\nclasses](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nPlease note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires\nyou to import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@pseudoElement iron-flex-layout\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nconst template =

To use the default set of\nicons, import `iron-icons.js` and use the `icon` attribute to specify an icon:\n\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      import \"@polymer/iron-icons/iron-icons.js\";\n    </script>\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"menu\"></iron-icon>\n\nTo use a different built-in set of icons, import the specific\n`iron-icons/<iconset>-icons.js`, and specify the icon as `<iconset>:<icon>`.\nFor example, to use a communication icon, you would use:\n\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      import \"@polymer/iron-icons/communication-icons.js\";\n    </script>\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"communication:email\"></iron-icon>\n\nYou can also create custom icon sets of bitmap or SVG icons.\n\nExample of using an icon named `cherry` from a custom iconset with the ID\n`fruit`:\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"fruit:cherry\"></iron-icon>\n\nSee `<iron-iconset>` and `<iron-iconset-svg>` for more information about how to\ncreate a custom iconset.\n\nSee the `iron-icons` demo to see the icons available in the various iconsets.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--iron-icon` | Mixin applied to the icon | {}\n`--iron-icon-width` | Width of the icon | `24px`\n`--iron-icon-height` | Height of the icon | `24px`\n`--iron-icon-fill-color` | Fill color of the svg icon | `currentcolor`\n`--iron-icon-stroke-color` | Stroke color of the svg icon | none\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@element iron-icon\n@demo demo/index.html\n@hero hero.svg\n@homepage polymer.github.io\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        @apply --layout-inline;\n        @apply --layout-center-center;\n        position: relative;\n\n        vertical-align: middle;\n\n        fill: var(--iron-icon-fill-color, currentcolor);\n        stroke: var(--iron-icon-stroke-color, none);\n\n        width: var(--iron-icon-width, 24px);\n        height: var(--iron-icon-height, 24px);\n        @apply --iron-icon;\n      }\n\n      :host([hidden]) {\n        display: none;\n      }\n    </style>\n`,\n\n  is: 'iron-icon',\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * The name of the icon to use.

When the\nuser touches the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.\n\n`paper-icon-button` does not include a default icon set. To use icons from the\ndefault set, include `PolymerElements/iron-icons/iron-icons.html`, and use the\n`icon` attribute to specify which icon from the icon set to use.\n\n    <paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"></paper-icon-button>\n\nSee [`iron-iconset`](iron-iconset) for more information about\nhow to use a custom icon set.\n\nExample:\n\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      import '@polymer/iron-icons/iron-icons.js';\n    </script>\n\n    <paper-icon-button icon=\"favorite\"></paper-icon-button>\n    <paper-icon-button src=\"star.png\"></paper-icon-button>\n\nTo use `paper-icon-button` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag. Since\n`paper-icon-button` will already receive focus, you may want to prevent the\nanchor tag from receiving focus as well by setting its tabindex to -1.\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.polymer-project.org\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n      <paper-icon-button icon=\"polymer\"></paper-icon-button>\n    </a>\n\n### Styling\n\nStyle the button with CSS as you would a normal DOM element. If you are using\nthe icons provided by `iron-icons`, they will inherit the foreground color of\nthe button.\n\n    /* make a red \"favorite\" button *\\/\n    <paper-icon-button icon=\"favorite\" style=\"color: red;\"></paper-icon-button>\n\nBy default, the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity.

The\neffect can be visualized as a concentric circle with motion.\n\nExample:\n\n    <div style=\"position:relative\">\n      <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n    </div>\n\nNote, it's important that the parent container of the ripple be relative\nposition, otherwise the ripple will emanate outside of the desired container.\n\n`paper-ripple` listens to \"mousedown\" and \"mouseup\" events so it would display\nripple effect when touches on it.  You can also defeat the default behavior and\nmanually route the down and up actions to the ripple element.  Note that it is\nimportant if you call `downAction()` you will have to make sure to call\n`upAction()` so that `paper-ripple` would end the animation loop.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-ripple id=\"ripple\" style=\"pointer-events: none;\"></paper-ripple>\n    ...\n    downAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.downAction(e.detail);\n    },\n    upAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.upAction();\n    }\n\nStyling ripple effect:\n\n  Use CSS color property to style the ripple:\n\n    paper-ripple {\n      color: #4285f4;\n    }\n\n  Note that CSS color property is inherited so it is not required to set it on\n  the `paper-ripple` element directly.\n\nBy default, the ripple is centered on the point of contact.  Apply the\n`recenters` attribute to have the ripple grow toward the center of its\ncontainer.\n\n    <paper-ripple recenters></paper-ripple>\n\nYou can also  center the ripple inside its container from the start.\n\n    <paper-ripple center></paper-ripple>\n\nApply `circle` class to make the rippling effect within a circle.\n\n    <paper-ripple class=\"circle\"></paper-ripple>\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-ripple\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\nPolymer({\n  _template: html`\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: block;\n        position: absolute;\n        border-radius: inherit;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        top: 0;\n        left: 0;\n        right: 0;\n        bottom: 0;\n\n        /* See PolymerElements/paper-behaviors/issues/34.

In\n * addition, if a `dom-module` with the same id exists, the first template\n * in that `dom-module` will be stamped into the shadow root of this element,\n * with support for declarative event listeners (`on-...`), Polymer data\n * bindings (`[[...]]` and `{{...}}`), and id-based node finding into\n * `this.$`.\n *\n * `properties`: Object describing property-related metadata used by Polymer\n * features (key: property names, value: object containing property metadata).\n * Valid keys in per-property metadata include:\n * - `type` (String|Number|Object|Array|...): Used by\n *   `attributeChangedCallback` to determine how string-based attributes\n *   are deserialized to JavaScript property values.\n * - `notify` (boolean): Causes a change in the property to fire a\n *   non-bubbling event called `<property>-changed`. Elements that have\n *   enabled two-way binding to the property use this event to observe changes.\n * - `readOnly` (boolean): Creates a getter for the property, but no setter.\n *   To set a read-only property, use the private setter method\n *   `_setProperty(property, value)`.\n * - `observer` (string): Observer method name that will be called when\n *   the property changes. The arguments of the method are\n *   `(value, previousValue)`.\n * - `computed` (string): String describing method and dependent properties\n *   for computing the value of this property (e.g. `'computeFoo(bar, zot)'`).\n *   Computed properties are read-only by default and can only be changed\n *   via the return value of the computing method.\n *\n * `observers`: Array of strings describing multi-property observer methods\n *  and their dependent properties (e.g. `'observeABC(a, b, c)'`).\n *\n * `listeners`: Object describing event listeners to be added to each\n *  instance of this element (key: event name, value: method name).\n *\n * `behaviors`: Array of additional `info` objects containing metadata\n * and callbacks in the same format as the `info` object here which are\n * merged into this element.\n *\n * `hostAttributes`: Object listing attributes to be applied to the host\n *  once created (key: attribute name, value: attribute value).  Values\n *  are serialized based on the type of the value.  Host attributes should\n *  generally be limited to attributes such as `tabIndex` and `aria-...`.\n *  Attributes in `hostAttributes` are only applied if a user-supplied\n *  attribute is not already present (attributes in markup override\n *  `hostAttributes`).\n *\n * In addition, the following Polymer-specific callbacks may be provided:\n * - `registered`: called after first instance of this element,\n * - `created`: called during `constructor`\n * - `attached`: called during `connectedCallback`\n * - `detached`: called during `disconnectedCallback`\n * - `ready`: called before first `attached`, after all properties of\n *   this element have been propagated to its template and all observers\n *   have run\n *\n * @param {!PolymerInit} info Object containing Polymer metadata and functions\n *   to become class methods.\n * @template T\n * @param {function(T):T} mixin Optional mixin to apply to legacy base class\n *   before extending with Polymer metaprogramming.\n * @return {function(new:HTMLElement)} Generated class\n */\nexport const Class = function(info, mixin) {\n  if (!info) {\n    console.warn('Polymer.Class requires `info` argument');\n  }\n  let klass = mixin ? mixin(LegacyElementMixin(HTMLElement)) :\n      LegacyElementMixin(HTMLElement);\n  klass = GenerateClassFromInfo(info, klass, info.behaviors);\n  // decorate klass with registration info\n  klass.is = klass.prototype.is = info.is;\n  return klass;\n};\n","/**\n@license\nCopyright (c) 2017 The Polymer Project Authors.

Instancing the class will result in the\n * template being stamped into a document fragment stored as the instance's\n * `root` property, after which it can be appended to the DOM.\n *\n * Templates may utilize all Polymer data-binding features as well as\n * declarative event listeners.  Event listeners and inline computing\n * functions in the template will be called on the host of the template.\n *\n * The constructor returned takes a single argument dictionary of initial\n * property values to propagate into template bindings.  Additionally\n * host properties can be forwarded in, and instance properties can be\n * notified out by providing optional callbacks in the `options` dictionary.\n *\n * Valid configuration in `options` are as follows:\n *\n * - `forwardHostProp(property, value)`: Called when a property referenced\n *   in the template changed on the template's host. As this library does\n *   not retain references to templates instanced by the user, it is the\n *   templatize owner's responsibility to forward host property changes into\n *   user-stamped instances.  The `instance.forwardHostProp(property, value)`\n *    method on the generated class should be called to forward host\n *   properties into the template to prevent unnecessary property-changed\n *   notifications. Any properties referenced in the template that are not\n *   defined in `instanceProps` will be notified up to the template's host\n *   automatically.\n * - `instanceProps`: Dictionary of property names that will be added\n *   to the instance by the templatize owner.  These properties shadow any\n *   host properties, and changes within the template to these properties\n *   will result in `notifyInstanceProp` being called.\n * - `mutableData`: When `true`, the generated class will skip strict\n *   dirty-checking for objects and arrays (always consider them to be\n *   \"dirty\").\n * - `notifyInstanceProp(instance, property, value)`: Called when\n *   an instance property changes.  Users may choose to call `notifyPath`\n *   on e.g. the owner to notify the change.\n * - `parentModel`: When `true`, events handled by declarative event listeners\n *   (`on-event=\"handler\"`) will be decorated with a `model` property pointing\n *   to the template instance that stamped it.  It will also be returned\n *   from `instance.parentModel` in cases where template instance nesting\n *   causes an inner model to shadow an outer model.\n *\n * All callbacks are called bound to the `owner`. Any context\n * needed for the callbacks (such as references to `instances` stamped)\n * should be stored on the `owner` such that they can be retrieved via\n * `this`.\n *\n * When `options.forwardHostProp` is declared as an option, any properties\n * referenced in the template will be automatically forwarded from the host of\n * the `<template>` to instances, with the exception of any properties listed in\n * the `options.instanceProps` object.  `instanceProps` are assumed to be\n * managed by the owner of the instances, either passed into the constructor\n * or set after the fact.  Note, any properties passed into the constructor will\n * always be set to the instance (regardless of whether they would normally\n * be forwarded from the host).\n *\n * Note that `templatize()` can be run only once for a given `<template>`.\n * Further calls will result in an error. Also, there is a special\n * behavior if the template was duplicated through a mechanism such as\n * `<dom-repeat>` or `<test-fixture>`. In this case, all calls to\n * `templatize()` return the same class for all duplicates of a template.\n * The class returned from `templatize()` is generated only once using\n * the `options` from the first call. This means that any `options`\n * provided to subsequent calls will be ignored. Therefore, it is very\n * important not to close over any variables inside the callbacks. Also,\n * arrow functions must be avoided because they bind the outer `this`.\n * Inside the callbacks, any contextual information can be accessed\n * through `this`, which points to the `owner`.\n *\n * @param {!HTMLTemplateElement} template Template to templatize\n * @param {Polymer_PropertyEffects=} owner Owner of the template instances;\n *   any optional callbacks will be bound to this owner.\n * @param {Object=} options Options dictionary (see summary for details)\n * @return {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase)} Generated class bound to the template\n *   provided\n * @suppress {invalidCasts}\n */\nexport function templatize(template, owner, options) {\n  // Under strictTemplatePolicy, the templatized element must be owned\n  // by a (trusted) Polymer element, indicated by existence of _methodHost;\n  // e.g. for dom-if & dom-repeat in main document, _methodHost is null\n  if (strictTemplatePolicy && !findMethodHost(template)) {\n    throw new Error('strictTemplatePolicy: template owner not trusted');\n  }\n  options = /** @type {!TemplatizeOptions} */(options || {});\n  if (template.__templatizeOwner) {\n    throw new Error('A <template> can only be templatized once');\n  }\n  template.__templatizeOwner = owner;\n  const ctor = owner ? owner.constructor : TemplateInstanceBase;\n  let templateInfo = ctor._parseTemplate(template);\n  // Get memoized base class for the prototypical template, which\n  // includes property effects for binding template & forwarding\n  /**\n   * @constructor\n   * @extends {TemplateInstanceBase}\n   */\n  let baseClass = templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass;\n  if (!baseClass) {\n    baseClass = createTemplatizerClass(template, templateInfo, options);\n    templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass = baseClass;\n  }\n  // Host property forwarding must be installed onto template instance\n  addPropagateEffects(template, templateInfo, options);\n  // Subclass base class and add reference for this specific template\n  /** @private */\n  let klass = class TemplateInstance extends baseClass {};\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype._methodHost = findMethodHost(template);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__dataHost = /** @type {!DataTemplate} */ (template);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__templatizeOwner = /** @type {!Object} */ (owner);\n  /** @override */\n  klass.prototype.__hostProps = templateInfo.hostProps;\n  klass = /** @type {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase)} */(klass); //eslint-disable-line no-self-assign\n  return klass;\n}\n\n/**\n * Returns the template \"model\" associated with a given element, which\n * serves as the binding scope for the template instance the element is\n * contained in.

This is accomplished by changing the property set to this:\n *\n *    --foo_-_border: 2px solid red;\n *    --foo_-_color: initial;\n *    --foo_-_background: initial;\n *\n * This works but introduces one new issue.\n * Consider this setup at the point where the `@apply` is used:\n *\n *    background: orange;\n *    `@apply` --foo;\n *\n * In this case the background will be unset (initial) rather than the desired\n * `orange`. We address this by altering the property set to use a fallback\n * value like this:\n *\n *    color: var(--foo_-_color);\n *    background: var(--foo_-_background, orange);\n *    border: var(--foo_-_border);\n *\n * Note that the default is retained in the property set and the `background` is\n * the desired `orange`. This leads us to a limitation.\n *\n * Limitation 1:\n\n * Only properties in the rule where the `@apply`\n * is used are considered as default values.\n * If another rule matches the element and sets `background` with\n * less specificity than the rule in which `@apply` appears,\n * the `background` will not be set.\n *\n * Limitation 2:\n *\n * When using Polymer's `updateStyles` api, new

The `scopeName` will be added to\n * the class attribute of all rendered DOM. In addition, any style elements will\n * be automatically re-written with this `scopeName` selector and moved out\n * of the rendered DOM and into the document `<head>`.\n *\n * It is common to use this render method in conjunction with a custom element\n * which renders a shadowRoot. When this is done, typically the element's\n * `localName` should be used as the `scopeName`.\n *\n * In addition to DOM scoping, ShadyCSS also supports a basic shim for css\n * custom properties (needed only on older browsers like IE11) and a shim for\n * a deprecated feature called `@apply` that supports applying a set of css\n * custom properties to a given location.\n *\n * Usage considerations:\n *\n * * Part values in `<style>` elements are only applied the first time a given\n * `scopeName` renders. Subsequent changes to parts in style elements will have\n * no effect. Because of this, parts in style elements should only be used for\n * values that will never change, for example parts that set scope-wide theme\n * values or parts which render shared style elements.\n *\n * * Note, due to a limitation of the ShadyDOM polyfill, rendering in a\n * custom element's `constructor` is not supported.

In other words, instead of flowing from\n * parent to child as do native css custom properties, shimmed custom properties\n * flow only from shadowRoots to nested shadowRoots.\n *\n * * When using `@apply` mixing css shorthand property names with\n * non-shorthand names (for example `border` and `border-width`) is not\n * supported.\n */\nexport const render =\n    (result: TemplateResult,\n     container: Element|DocumentFragment|ShadowRoot,\n     options: ShadyRenderOptions) => {\n      const scopeName = options.scopeName;\n      const hasRendered = parts.has(container);\n      const needsScoping = compatibleShadyCSSVersion &&\n          container.nodeType === 11 /* Node.DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE */ &&\n          !!(container as ShadowRoot).host && result instanceof TemplateResult;\n      // Handle first render to a scope specially...\n      const firstScopeRender = needsScoping && !shadyRenderSet.has(scopeName);\n      // On first scope render, render into a fragment; this cannot be a single\n      // fragment that is reused since nested renders can occur synchronously.\n      const renderContainer =\n          firstScopeRender ? document.createDocumentFragment() : container;\n      litRender(\n          result,\n          renderContainer,\n          {templateFactory: shadyTemplateFactory(scopeName), ...options} as\n              RenderOptions);\n      // When performing first scope render,\n      // (1) We've rendered into a fragment so that there's a chance to\n      // `prepareTemplateStyles` before sub-elements hit the DOM\n      // (which might cause them to render based on a common pattern of\n      // rendering in a custom element's `connectedCallback`);\n      // (2) Scope the template with ShadyCSS one time only for this scope.\n      // (3) Render the fragment into the container and make sure the\n      // container knows its `part` is the one we just rendered.
